# Travelix

##### * This application is called Travelix. The purpose of this application is to allow users to reserve different events in Belgrade and Zagreb. It is like an application for a travel agency. 
##### * User is able to log in, reserve the program, and cancel it. With reserving a particular program, specific event, accommodation and transport are included. The user has the option to filter events. One user can only reserve one event. The editing profile is available.
##### * Admin has the option to see all events, their revenue, and the number of guests. There is a possibility to add everything that is related to events such as a new transport,  hotel, or whole program.  There are also interesting statistics for Admin. #####
